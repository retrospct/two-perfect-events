## üöÄ DatoCMS Integration [>>](https://tpe.admin.datocms.com/editor)

- [gatsby-source-datocms](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-datocms/) and dependency for [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/) were added along with some of the gatsby-starter-datocms code which is suffixed with \*-cms.js.
- None of the sass styling and packages were installed for this code so it will be unstyled. The content is being pulled from our DatoCMS project though.

## üëæ Install

You will need to have `node` and `yarn` installed.

You can use `npx` (recommended) or install the `gatsby-cli` globally.

Clone and install the project:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:retrospct/two-perfect-events.git
cd two-perfect-events
yarn
```

## üõ∏ Contribute

> This section is a WIP

This project uses concepts from [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for branching. I recommend going through the GitHub Flow link first and then skimming the branching portions of the Git Flow article. It's not much reading overall, shouldn't take too much time.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Develop

To start the development servers:

```sh
yarn develop
```

If all was successful, you should see links to two development servers in the Node terminal. You can open these url in any browser that you would like.

- [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

This is the development server that allows you to preview your website. It comes with hot-module reloading, which means that you should see your changes almost immediately without having to refresh the browser tab.

- [http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql):

This is the development server that allows you to interact with the your site's GraphQL data via the GraphiQL IDE.

## üòé Styling

This library is pre-configured with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

### Global Styles

Global styles are defined in the `src/styles/global-styles.tsx` file using the `createGlobalStyle` function provided by styled-components. The global styles are injected in the `Layout` component via the component that is provided from the `createGlobalStyle` function.

The global style also includes the styles from [css-modern-reset](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/modern-css-reset), which aims to provide a sensible reset of browser styles.

### Theme

You can define your theme styles in the `/src/styles/theme` file. The theme will be available in any styled-component via `props.theme` and to any other component via the `useTheme` hook.

### Handling Media Queries

The theme utilizes the [use-media](https://github.com/streamich/use-media) library, which allows you to track the state of a CSS media queries. This works by passing a boolean for each screen size that you defined in your theme. Just define your screen sizes in `src/styles/theme`.

### Styling Examples

**`src/pages/about.tsx` includes various examples (with comments) of using styled-components and framer-motion with the theme provider.**

### The CSS Prop

This starter is also preconfigured to work with the `css` prop:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <h1
      css={`
        color: #333;
      `}
    >
      Hello World!
    </h1>
  </div>
)
```

_Note: The `css` prop does not play nicely with the `jsx-no-multiline-js` ESLint rule. You may want to disable the rule if you plan on using the `css` prop. This can be done in the `.eslintrc.js` file._

I personally do not use the `css` prop and prefer to define styled-components outside of the component definition. My general rule is if the component that is using a styled-component is the only component that uses it, I define the styled-component in the same file. Otherwise, I will move it out to a `components/common` directory.

```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Heading = styled.h1`
  color: #333;
`

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Heading>Hello World!</Heading>
  </div>
)
```

## üêû CSS Debugger

This starter also includes a `CSSDebugger` component. This component allows you to easily debug your styles by drawing outlines around all elements and applying a grid in the background. It also includes a toggle button that you can optionally use during debugging.

**_Note: You can drag the toggle button around if it gets in your way._**

The `CSSDebugger` component is used in the `layout.tsx` component.

## üåü Linting

This project includes a combination of ESLint, TSLint, and React-A11y rules for React and TypeScript code, which are extended from the [eslint-config-gojutin](https://github.com/gojutin/eslint-config-gojutin) npm package. Many of the rules favor a functional approach with a strong emphasis on immutability and strong type definitions. Since all of the rules and dependencies are included in this package, you can easily remove it if you prefer to wire up your own linting configuration.

The rules are listed as key/value pairs. The key represents the rule name and the value (number) represents the setting of the rule:

|     |       |
| --- | :---- |
| `0` | off   |
| `1` | warn  |
| `2` | error |

Here is an example of a rule:

```js
"immutable/no-this": 2
```

This particular rule disallows the use of the `this` keyword, which will result in an error.

## üìï Storybook

Storybook is available by creating stories in the `src/stories` directory and running the `yarn storybook` script. Your storybook will be availble at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

You can also compile a production build of your Storybook by running `yarn build:storybook`. The compiled production build will be located in a `/storybook-static` directory.

## üïπ Testing

> This section is a WIP, tests will be enforced via GitHub Actions but tooling should be used in development. Will add more info later.

Lint your files and fix all linting issues.

```sh
yarn lint
```

Run your test suite and fix any broken tests.

```sh
yarn test
```

## üí´ Deploy

> This section is a WIP. CI/CD pipeline not fully configured but the basics are already setup for deploy.

- [ ] Automate and enforce linting, best practices, styling, and tests with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Document the deployment pipeline
- [ ] Setup the remaining deployment pipeline

> ex: **feature\_\*** or **fix\_\*** (_merge_) > **develop** (_PR, preview generated_) > _\*not setup yet\*_ **stage** (_PR, deploy to prod once approved_) > **master** (_prod_)
